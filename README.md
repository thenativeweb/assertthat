# node-assertthat

node-assertthat provides a fluent TDD style for Node.js: `assert.that(actual, is.equalTo(expected));`

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me using [@goloroden](https://twitter.com/goloroden) on Twitter.

## Installation

    $ npm install node-assertthat

## Quick Start

Using node-assertthat is easy. All you need to do is to add a reference to it within your Node.js application:

```javascript
var assert = require('node-assertthat');
```

Now you are able to use the various constraints:

```javascript
var add = function(first, second) {
  return first + second;
};

var actual = add(23, 42),
    expected = 65;

assert.that(actual, is.equalTo(expected));
```

Please note that node-assertthat extends Node's assert module, i.e. all the code you have been used to will work with node-assertthat as well.

That's it :-)!

## Available constraints

Please note that any constraint can be negated using the `not` keyword.

### is.atLeast

Asserts that `actual` is greater than or equal to `expected`.

```javascript
assert.that(actual, is.atLeast(expected));
assert.that(actual, is.not.atLeast(expected));
```

### is.atMost

Asserts that `actual` is less than or equal to `expected`.

```javascript
assert.that(actual, is.atMost(expected));
assert.that(actual, is.not.atMost(expected));
```

### is.between

Asserts that `actual` is between `expectedLow` and `expectedHigh`.

```javascript
assert.that(actual, is.between(expectedLow, expectedHigh));
assert.that(actual, is.not.between(expectedLow, expectedHigh));
```

### is.equalTo

Asserts that `actual` is equal to `expected`.

```javascript
assert.that(actual, is.equalTo(expected));
assert.that(actual, is.not.equalTo(expected));
```

### is.false

Asserts that `actual` is false.

```javascript
assert.that(actual, is.false());
assert.that(actual, is.not.false());
```

### is.falsy

Asserts that `actual` is falsy.

```javascript
assert.that(actual, is.falsy());
assert.that(actual, is.not.falsy());
```

### is.greaterThan

Asserts that `actual` is greater than `expected`.

```javascript
assert.that(actual, is.greaterThan(expected));
assert.that(actual, is.not.greaterThan(expected));
```

### is.lessThan

Asserts that `actual` is less than `expected`.

```javascript
assert.that(actual, is.lessThan(expected));
assert.that(actual, is.not.lessThan(expected));
```

### is.NaN

Asserts that `actual` is NaN.

```javascript
assert.that(actual, is.NaN());
assert.that(actual, is.not.NaN());
```

### is.null

Asserts that `actual` is null.

```javascript
assert.that(actual, is.null());
assert.that(actual, is.not.null());
```

### is.ofType

Asserts that `actual` is of type `expected`.

```javascript
assert.that(actual, is.ofType(expected));
assert.that(actual, is.not.ofType(expected));
```

### is.sameAs

Asserts that `actual` is identical to `expected`.

```javascript
assert.that(actual, is.sameAs(expected));
assert.that(actual, is.not.sameAs(expected));
```

### is.throwing

Asserts that `f` throws an exception.

```javascript
assert.that(f, is.throwing());
assert.that(f, is.not.throwing());
```

### is.throwingMsg

Asserts that `f` throws an exception with a Message `msg`.

```javascript
assert.that(f, is.throwingMsg('msg'));
assert.that(f, is.not.throwingMsg('msg'));
```


### is.true

Asserts that `actual` is true.

```javascript
assert.that(actual, is.true());
assert.that(actual, is.not.true());
```

### is.undefined

Asserts that `actual` is undefined.

```javascript
assert.that(actual, is.undefined());
assert.that(actual, is.not.undefined());
```

## Running the tests

node-assertthat has been developed using TDD. To run the tests, go to the folder where you have installed node-assertthat to and run `npm test`. You need to have [mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) installed.

    $ npm test
