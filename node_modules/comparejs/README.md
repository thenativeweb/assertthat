# comparejs

comparejs implements JavaScript's comparison operators for Node.js and the browser the way you would expect them to be.

If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to contact me using [@goloroden](https://twitter.com/goloroden) on Twitter.

## Installing

### Node.js

Basically, using comparejs in Node.js is easy. All you need to do is install it using `npm` by running the
following command:

    $ npm install comparejs

Then, you can reference it from your application by adding the following line:

```javascript
var cmp = require('comparejs');
```

### In the browser

Using comparejs in the browser is easy, too. All you need to do here is add a script reference within your web
site. If you want to use the latest version hosted on GitHub, use:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.github.com/goloroden/comparejs/master/bin/compare.min.js"></script>
```

If instead you want to use a specific version hosted on GitHub, use:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.github.com/goloroden/comparejs/master/bin/compare-[x.y.z].min.js"></script>
```

Of course you can also download any version manually and add a local reference.

If you are running Visual Studio, instead of downloading manually you can also install comparejs by using the
[NuGet package](http://nuget.org/packages/compare.js). For that run the following command inside the NuGet console:

    PM> Install-Package compare.js

*Note: The NuGet package was created by [Alexander Zeitler](http://www.pdmlab.com). Thanks for that :-)!*

## Features

- Supports comparison of `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `function`, `object`, `array` and `undefined`.
- Supports comparison of native data types and constructor-created data types, such as `number` and `new Number()`.
- Supports comparison of objects and arrays using deep-equal.
- Supports comparison of objects and arrays with `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` by handling them as subsets.
- Supports comparison of objects by structure.
- Supports comparison with `undefined` correctly, as `<=` and `>=` are problematic in plain JavaScript.
- Supports comparison in a perfectly type-safe way out-of-the-box.
- Supports comparison by equality and identity, depending on what makes sense.
- Developed using TDD and backed up by more than 930 unit tests.

## Basic usage

Now you are able to use the various comparison operators. All you need to do is access the `cmp` object and
use its functions:

<table>
  <tr><th>Operator</th><th>Alias</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>cmp.eq(first, second)</td><td>cmp.equal(first, second)</td><td>equal</td></tr>
  <tr><td>cmp.ne(first, second)</td><td>cmp.notEqual(first, second)</td><td>not equal</td></tr>
  <tr><td>cmp.gt(first, second)</td><td>cmp.greaterThan(first, second)</td><td>greater than</td></tr>
  <tr><td>cmp.ge(first, second)</td><td>cmp.greaterThanOrEqual(first, second)</td><td>greater than or equal</td></tr>
  <tr><td>cmp.lt(first, second)</td><td>cmp.lessThan(first, second)</td><td>less than</td></tr>
  <tr><td>cmp.le(first, second)</td><td>cmp.lessThanOrEqual(first, second)</td><td>less than or equal</td></tr>
  <tr><td>cmp.id(first, second)</td><td>cmp.identical(first, second)</td><td>identical</td></tr>
</table>

Please note that each comparison operator works on each combination of types and does what you would expect it to do.

## Structure comparison operators

For objects, there are special operators that compare by structure. Among other things, they can be used to verify objects against interfaces:

<table>
  <tr><th>Operator</th><th>Alias</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>cmp.eqs(first, second)</td><td>cmp.equalByStructure(first, second)</td><td>equal by structure</td></tr>
  <tr><td>cmp.nes(first, second)</td><td>cmp.notEqualByStructure(first, second)</td><td>not equal by structure</td></tr>
  <tr><td>cmp.gts(first, second)</td><td>cmp.greaterThanByStructure(first, second)</td><td>greater than by structure</td></tr>
  <tr><td>cmp.ges(first, second)</td><td>cmp.greaterThanOrEqualByStructure(first, second)</td><td>greater than or equal by structure</td></tr>
  <tr><td>cmp.lts(first, second)</td><td>cmp.lessThanByStructure(first, second)</td><td>less than by structure</td></tr>
  <tr><td>cmp.les(first, second)</td><td>cmp.lessThanOrEqualByStructure(first, second)</td><td>less than or equal by structure</td></tr>
</table>

Please note that these operators only work for objects. For any other type, they return `false`.

## Running the tests

comparejs has been developed using TDD. To run the tests, go to the folder where you have installed comparejs to and run `npm test`. You need to have [mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) installed.

    $ npm test

That's it :-)!
